# Some Copilot prompts to try...

```
Summarize messages from my manager in the last week. I'd like each email to be presented with the subject line bolded for quick reference, followed by a bulleted list of key points or action items from the content
```

Summarize my mails, Teams messages and channel messages from the last workday. List action items in a dedicated column. Suggest follow-ups if possible in a dedicated column. The table should look like this: Type (Mail/Teams/Channel) | Topic | Summarization | Action item | Follow-up. If I have been directly mentioned, make the font of the topic bold. I prefer accuracy over speed.

Describe in a paragraph what my day looked like today and use bold text to highlight logical topics. Also, generate a table of recently updated Office documents which are likely relevant to me, list their filename which and don't forget to include who modified it. Also, give me a table of action points assigned to me coming from todays received teams chats or emails and sort them by date received ascending. Also, summarize my planned meetings tomorrow to get me prepared for the day. Include the attendees of the meeting. From the internet: show headlines of todays tech news related to generative AI in bullet points.  Don't forget an original 'quote of the day' which makes me smile, related to the end of the day when finishing up work.
